# Complete Block Check:  PostgreSQL Storage Benchmark

Complete Block Check (CBC) stresses multiple major parts of block I/O
in the database using synthetic test data.  It was developed against
PostgreSQL 15 and uses CREATE TABLE AS, VACUUM, CREATE INDEX, and
CLUSTER.  Two simple but difficult to execute queries are run along the way,
initially with a Sequential Scan.  By the end one query should use a
quick indexed lookup.

To learn about the individual statements of CBC, how and why they work, see
the [CBC Tutorial](cbc-tutorial.md) in this same directory.

# Background

I’ve evaluated many benchmark ideas that stress storage before, usually using `pgbench` to generate the test database and workload.
When I was working on loading the Open Street Map data, I noticed that
`CREATE TABLE AS` is really fast now, fast enough to be a load generator
if you have a wide table to work with.  And there is a wide table in the
system views!  `pg_settings` has a lot of columns of all sorts of data
types, a lot more variation than the trivial `pgbench` tables.

# Example collector output

Here's a lightly formatted example via the collector script.
Hardware is AMD 7700X processor, 128GB RAM, SK41 2TB SSD; times
are in milliseconds, sizes in bytes, disk rates in MB/s:

	SERVER        siren
	CREATE_TABLE  33116.420
	VACUUM        9293.740
	CREATE_INDEX  36316.109
	SELECT_u1     832.447
	SELECT_b      209.221
	SELECT_r      2443.925
	CLUSTER       87918.913
	SELECT_u2     81.555
	SELECT_c      80.997
	SIZE_T        21837168640
	SIZE_I        636223488
	READ_RATE     2277.521
	WRITE_RATE    2279.278

The READ/WRITE_RATE figures come from the VACUUM command and
only apply to that line.  During benchmark development, that command
was frequently the highest rate step.  Note that this server was
configured for performance rather than reliability, with WAL and
all nornal sync work disabled.  In a default configuration vacuum
work will usually hit a WAL bottleneck before it stresses CPU and
disk to the extent this sample does.

# psql driver

You can run a CBC in command line `psql` like this:

	psql -d $DB -v scale=$SIZEDB -ef cbc-psql.sql > $OUTBASE.log 2>&1

For testing in a browser `psql` like the Crunchy PostgreSQL Playground,
you just have to put the scale number in manually instead:

	\set SIZEGB 1

# CLI collector driver

The program includes a standalone results collector script named
`cbc` that runs the benchmark and saves to a text file in results/ directory.

Inputs:

* Database size in GB.  Defaults to 20.

Output is in the key/value style, shown as an example above.

# pgbench driver

The workload runs in `pgbench` utilizing its scale setting.  To make
this compatible with using `pgbench-tools` to monitor each step, they are split the pieces up into individual files, also allowing execution by multiple
clients.  Currently that includes:

	cbc-t00-ctas.sql	cbc-t01-vacuum.sql	cbc-t02-index.sql
	cbc-t03-select-max.sql	cbc-t04-selectr.sql	cbc-t05-cluster.sql

The full series of pgbench tests have been packed into a workload script
in the source tree at `wl/cbc` that includes multiple client counts for
the SELECT statements.

Here's a manual run of the benchmark steps using `pgbench` to monitor each step:

	createdb cbc
	psql -d cbc -c "DROP TABLE settings_loop"
	pgbench -n -t 1 -c 1 -s 20 -f cbc-t00-ctas.sql cbc
	pgbench -n -t 1 -c 1 -s 20 -f cbc-t01-vacuum.sql cbc
	pgbench -n -t 1 -c 1 -s 20 -f cbc-t02-index.sql cbc
	pgbench -n -t 1 -c 1 -s 20 -f cbc-t03-select-max.sql cbc
	pgbench -n -t 1 -c 1 -s 20 -f cbc-t03-select-max.sql cbc
	pgbench -n -t 1 -c 1 -s 20 -f cbc-t04-selectr.sql cbc
	pgbench -n -t 1 -c 1 -s 20 -f cbc-t05-cluster.sql cbc
	pgbench -n -t 1 -c 1 -s 20 -f cbc-t03-select-max.sql cbc
	pgbench -n -t 1 -c 1 -s 20 -f cbc-t03-select-max.sql cbc

Many of these steps can only run once.  The main SELECT query can
of course be run in parallel.  This example starts 4 clients running
it for 120 seconds, same as the automated workload because that's usually enough to observe heat issues:

	pgbench -n -T 120 -c 4 -s 20 -f cbc-t03-select-max.sql cbc

Note that while the other methods of running CBC allow fractions of a GB
for the size setting, `pgbench` scales must be integers of 1 or larger.
To test <1GB configurations with `pgbench` you'd need to adjust the way
the input scale is handled.

# Automated workload driver

A pgbench CBC workload driver at `wl/cbc` is available to make it easier
to run every step with individual metrics collection.  `pgbench-tools` workloads generate a series of configuration files, run each test
with `pgbench`, and save the results into a results database for analysis.  A sample report at `reports/cbc-best.sql` shows the results with associated disk metrics.  On the Mac this includes only disk0 throughput.

The workload version of CBC also includes a second copy of the
`cbc-t03-select-max` script labeled with an "i", to distinguish the runs
expected to use an index.  The test itself is identical, the script name
is simply `cbc-t03i-select-max` instead.  A case could be made that
this should be named the t06 step.  t03i was used to sort the results
for with/without an index next to each other.

# Storage throughput validation

To prove that CBC is effective at stressing system storage, four test
systems were used:

* MacBook Pro 16:  M1 Pro CPU, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD
* MacBook Air 15:  M2 CPU, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD
* AMD Ryzen 7700X:  128GB RAM, 2TB SK41 SSD
* AMD Ryzen 5950X:  128GB RAM, 2TB Inland Performance PCI 4.0 SSD

Tests tried a range of sizes, and as usual for benchmarking like this
3-4X RAM was enough to reach maximum speed in most tests.

|CPU     |RAM |DB GB |Script      |Metric|Best |Max  |% Max
|--------|----|------|------------|------|-----|-----|-----
|M1 Pro  |  16|    32|t00-ctas    |R+W   |5107 |5263 |97%
|M2 Air  |   8|    20|t00-ctas    |R+W   |2556 |3238 |79%
|R9 5950X| 128|   384|t04-selectr |read  |4709 |5000 |94%
|R9 5950X| 128|   256|t00-ctas    |write |4072 |4300 |95%
|R7 7700X| 128|   384|t04-selectr |read  |6240 |7000 |89%
|R7 7700X| 128|   384|t00-ctas    |write |6529 |6500 |100%

On the Mac, disk I/O data collected with `iostat` groups read and write
operations into one total.  In theory then, the M1 Pro capable of 5263MB/s
writes and slightly higher reads has a true theoretical max combined
value of over 10GB/s.

Here though, max values for the Mac systems only reflect the one I/O
operation that the tests involved exercise.  For example, `t00-ctas` only
generates write traffic.  The max possible on that test is the system's best
write speed, not the max possible for the combined R+W metric being measured.

Some other systems were lightly tested as well, and only the systems
with strong thermal activity throttling failed to reach the 90% goal
development aimed at.  The passive cooling of the Mac M2 Air for example,
it's extremely hard to reach maximum I/O rates within its thermal
constraints.

# Credits

`cbc` was developed by Greg Smith as part of the PostgreSQL regression testing
effort at Crunchy Data.  The scripts are being initially released as part of
the `pgbench-tools` repository.

# Dedication

Greg's benchmark lab names its many servers after favorite songs.
The AMD AM5 7700X system used for this development was named for
"Siren Song" on the 1993 Alan Parsons Album `Try Anything Once`,
written by Alan Parsons Project guitarist Ian Bairnson with
composer Frank Musker.  Ian passed away in April of 2023 just
as `cbc` validation started on siren.  Ian was Greg's friend and
he went out at the top!  Ian played on Kate Bush's first hit, and her
"Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God)" (with APP drummer
Stuart Elliott) featured prominently in Season 4 of the hit show
`Stranger Things`.  That brought the song smashing back to the radio
internationally and filled Ian's last year with press coverage.
