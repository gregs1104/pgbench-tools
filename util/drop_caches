# Linux drop OS caching as postgres user, probably with sudo.
# Suggested install directory is /usr/local/bin
#
# For Debian/Ubuntu Linux installs, supports two optional parameters:
# version of PG and cluster name to restart as part of cache dropping.
# Sample:
#
#   /usr/local/bin/drop_caches 17 main
#
# Starting from a checkout of pgbench-tools into the postgres user's home directory, you
# likely need to run sudo as another user to install this, then add a sudo rule to allow
# the postgres user to run it.  This idiom works:
#
#    cp util/drop_caches /tmp
#    logout
#    sudo cp /tmp/drop_caches /usr/local/bin/
#    sudo sh -c "echo \"postgres ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/drop_caches\" >> /etc/sudoers.d/postgres"
#

#if [[ $(id -u) -ne 0 ]] ; then echo "Cache dropping must run as root" ; exit 1 ; fi

# TODO Should the cluster parameters be wrapped differently to reduce exploits?
if [ -n "$2" ] ; then
  svctl $1 $2 restart:wq
fi
